            During my undergraduate career, I originally majored in criminal justice to study people and see what I could do to make people’s lives better but that didn’t work out for me. Then I switched to an IT major because I enjoy being around technology and loved technological things but strictly being around technology wasn’t for me either. So I ended up majoring in Information Science for UX design because it’s the best of both worlds. I get to design for people around the world while being around technology.

            I'm excited to learn more and gain more experience within the UX/UI field whether it's a personal project or a project for an employer. I really just want to design and program things that will please whatever community I plan my projects around.
