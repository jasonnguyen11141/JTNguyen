            <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
            <p>I was tasked to compare Google Assistant with other Voice Assistants and recommend new features for Google Assistant. My main focus was researching on the customization of the Voice Assistants. I've read pages of similar products to Google Assistant such as Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa.   </p>

            <h2>Affinity Diagram</h2>
            <p>
                I worked with a team to organize an Affinity Diagram using Miro. Notes were gathered from user interviews and then grouped into categories. From there, we were able to identify patterns and insights that helped us understand user needs and pain points. The interviews were focused on online privacy. 
            </p>
            <p>
                There were hundreds of unorganized notes from a variety of users. First, we read through them and grouped each note we thought were related to each other.
