        <p>I’ve created a prototype to demonstrate what ZM_EE would look like. As presented in the shorthand flow, the
            user is able to view the main page and a dropdown that will display each map for each game presented. Once
            the user selects the map, there will be descriptive copywriting and images so the user can quickly
            understand. The user will be able to select which step they are on for maximum efficiency.

        <p>ZM_EE is a website to help quickly guide players to learn the main quest of a map. From Call of Duty World at
            War to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. This website will have a very minimalistic look to it with a very familiar
            color scheme of the Call of Duty: Black Ops logo. Each game will be divided and each map will have its own
            page with a thorough step-by-step instructions on how to solve the main quest and those instructions will be
            accompanied by images for much ease. </p>
        <p>This website was designed for players to learn or to get a quick refresher on how to complete the quest or
            where to find an object while they play the game simultaneously. Navigation will be easy as anchor scroll
            will be on every step of the map.</p>

        <p>This shorthand flow displays interactable features on ZM_EE. I wanted to create something easy to use and find so each user wouldn’t have to go digging to find whatever they want on the site. In the homescreen there will be a drop down for each game which will display each map that the game contains. Once the user selects the map, it will take them to the guide page. The guide page has a selection of steps if the user decides to skip ahead and it will take them to the section of the page that contains that step.

        <p>This project is still a work in progress. More information will be release soon as I continue my research
            as well as developing the website.</p>
